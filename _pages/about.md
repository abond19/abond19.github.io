I am a PhD student in the department of Computer Science and Engineering at Koç University. My thesis work relates to generative models for videos. I also do some work on mean-field analysis of machine learning algorithms.

My interests include machine learning models for video generation, editing, and understanding. Additionally, I am also interested in understanding many domains of mathematics and applying these domains to machine learning. These domains include Bayesian methods, convergence of probability measures and stochastic processes, and algebraic topology.
